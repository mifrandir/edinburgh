    "Clustering refers to a group of unsupervised learning algorithms, one of which is K-means. Each cluster is a group of data points in which points should be more similar to each other than they are to points in other clusters. Clustering is used to interpret and compress data. Interpretation can help to deepen our knowledge of the dataset. For example in medicine, we might be interested in particular clusters of symptoms of a disease. For example, researchers at King's College have identified six clusters of patterns of [Coronavirus symptoms over time](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.12.20129056v1.full.pdf). The cluster labels can then be used as independent variables with hospitalisation as dependent variable to build a model predicting the likelihood of hospitalisation given a cluster membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means belongs to the group of *partitional clustering* algorithms, in which we partition the data into $K$ non-overlapping clusters; each data point can only belong to exactly one cluster. If you are interested in other clustering algorithms, such as *hierarchical* or *density based* clustering, we invite you to read the following [paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40745-015-0040-1.pdf), or take IAML in your honours years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitional clustering algorithms are non-deterministic, which means that each run can lead to different clusters even on the same data set. The main benefits of partitional clustering algorithms are their simplicity and low computational complexity. However, they are also only well suited for spherical clusters and do not cope well with complex shapes. \n",
