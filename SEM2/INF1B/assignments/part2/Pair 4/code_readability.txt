In this case, A's implementation is definitely better.


While both code samples make use of the proper function documentation using @param and @return, that's where the similarities end. 

As far as I can tell, B's code does not contain any comments within the code himself that were not there in the default implementation. A on the other hand, uses short and concise comments to explain less obvious facts about the code. Whenever the code is not self-explanatory, A has made sure to include a helpful note.

Another important factor is the naming of functions and variables. Let's compare the implementation of FoxHoundIO.displayBoard. Both sides start by creating an object to hold the board information, in one case a String array and in the other a StringBuilder. Then B uses an if-else statement to differentiate between dimensions less than and greater than or equal to 10. Since I've worked on the same problem, I know why this has been done. Nonetheless, just from reading the code, the condition seems arbitrary. Even by comparing the two expressions that are executed in either case, it is not very visible what the difference actually is. Further A makes good use of separate functions with verbose but compact names like "genEmptyLine", "makeXKey" and "makeDisplayNum" all of which have their own documentation. B on the other hand only uses two separate functions to determine whether or not a certain board position has a fox or a hound (isFox/isHound). Additionally, there are no comments indicating what a certain section is supposed to achieve so it is entirely on the reader to figure out how the code achieves what the documentation claims. This is not made easier by the fact that there are multiple intransparent boolean conditions like "j == 0 || j == (dimension + 3)" which are hard to understand. A does, of course, use these kinds of conditions, too, but in their case there are helping comments  to explain what the check does.
