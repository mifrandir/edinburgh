*** PART III (10 pt) ***

# Plan

There are two separate questions in play here:

1. Is the Reed opening good against a general opponent?
2. Is the Reed opening good against a special opponent that *knows* your first two moves?

To understand why these are in fact different questions, one has to understand the
reasoning involved in making a move: In general, a rational player wants to make
the move that puts them into the best position regardless of what their opponent is
going to do next. Because of this, Reed may be good against a player A who takes all
possibilities into account because they are putting themselves into a disadvantage
against it, expecting a non-Reed move because it would lead to a worse position for
A. This reasoning is usually caused by quirks in the utility function. However, all
of this changes if A knows that B will play the Reed opening. Essentially, it allows
A to disregard all other moves and thus optimise their play by leaving weak spots
that they know for certain will not be exploited.

I will only discuss question (1) here as it seems to be more relevant.

To answer this interpretation of the question, we just need to run some games of the
Minimax player against the Reed player (Minimax player with two predefined moves). 
In particular, we should use different depths for our Minimax algorithm. 
In the end the highest value will be relevant but it might
be interesting how the opening performs against "weaker" players, i.e. Minimax with
a lower depth (which could represent a player only being able to calculate that many
depths in advance).

Of course seeing that "X" wins for example is not a lot of insight because maybe X wins
anyways. The most meaningful result to obtain would be if the opening changed the
result.

What will be interesting to try and explain the results. Maybe there is something that
becomes clear through gameplay that is especially good/bad about the Reed opening.

# Findings

I've run the test (scripts/reed_test.sh) with depths 4 and 6. Interestingly (and perhaps
reassuringly) both cases showed the same outcome and indeed identical behaviour. It seems
like there is an optimal way to play the game where one more ply of foresight does
not make a difference.
More importantly, the results are clear: the Reed opening is bad. The game is normally favoured
towards X. If X is forced to play the Reed opening though, Y wins in the duel.
