# Lecture 1/2, September 20

All life is made of 'ordinary matter'
$\Rightarrow$ Unusual, just 5%.

## Foundations of Matter

Matter consists of nucleons (protons & neutrons) and electrons.

Mass of a nucleon is $1.66 * 10 ^-27 kg$.

Size of nucleus is $\approx 10^-15$

### Isotopes

Isotopes are atoms of one element that have a different amount of neutrons.

Lighter isotopes of carbon may be used to look for life. Life tends to accumulate lighter C isotopes.

### Electron clouds

Atomic radius is $2-5 * 10 ^ -10 m$. Much bigger than nucleus.

### Idea

The Astrobiological Periodic Table.

## Bonding 

### Ionic bonding

- is the force of attraction between positively and negatively charged ions
- most ionic compounds are crystaline solid
  
"Atoms don't like spare electron shells"
$\Rightarrow$ Lowest energy state. (e.g. Sodium + Chlorine)

Atoms arrange themselves in a grid-like structure, naturally.

**NaF**:
- energy bond = $300\times 10 ^ -21 J$
- $E\approx k_b T$ is an atoms energy due to thermal motion.

Ionic bonds hold proteins together.

### Covalent Bonding 

- takes place between atoms with small differences in charge which are close to each other in the periodic table or identical atoms (e.g. hydrogen, carbon)
- is formed by sharing an outer electron
- it's a stable bond, 150 times less thermal energy than bonding energy
- prominent in extreme termperatures

$\Rightarrow$ All of this is universal.

### Metallic Bonding

- is the type of bonding found in metal elements - **not important for life**. THis is the electrostatic force of attraction between positively charged ions and declocalized electrons.
- there is no organism with a solid metal in their bodies; why?
  - rusting
  - not enough energy

### van der Waals Forces

#### Dipole-dipole Forces

- each molecule has a charge differences accros it's length

  $\Rightarrow$ small permanent dipole
  $\Rightarrow$ two dipoles attract each other

#### Induced dipole 

- a dipole inserts a charge

#### Dispersion Forces

- exists between all atoms and molecules
- due to uneven distribution of electrons in atom (by probability)

### Hydrogen Bonding

- found in molecules containing OH groups
- attraction of electrons of other molecules
- $1/10$ of a covalent bond 

Hydrogen bonds hold DNA together. Useful because they need to be broken and reassembled often.

> Summary of bonding types

> What you need to know

## States of Matter

sorted by increasing energy
- solid
- liquid
- gas
- plasma (99% of all ordinary matter)

(organisms are mad up of $0.046$% of matter)

triple point: point on a phase diagram where all three states of matter co-exist

> supercritical fluid

e.g. Mars:
- surface is not suited for life
- anything below that might be suitable

### Anomaly of water

- solid water has higher density
- higher pressure means more liquid than solid

    $\Rightarrow$ Habitat for life under water in winter.

### Other states of matter

#### Plasma

Hot plasma in nature:
- stars
- lightning
- Aurora Borealis

Not in structure of life. Yet, it's important for life.

#### Degenerate Matter

- collection of free, non-interacting particles
- occurs at very high density ($>10^3 \frac{kg}{cm^3}$)
- electrons can't fit in the smaller atom area

Exists in white dwarf stars. ($>10^5 \frac{kg}{cm^3}$)

Why is life on neutron stars hard?

- neutron stars tend to leave their star systems

# Lecture 4, September 23

## Fundamentals of Life

### Molecules

Six major elements: C, H, N, O, P, S

- Carbon
- Hydrogen
- Nitrogen
- Oxygen
- Phosphorus
- Sulfur

$\Rightarrow$ CHNOPS

Other elements (Calcium, Iron, ...) are important as well.

Carbon is the main backbone of all life on earth. 
$\Rightarrow$ Carbon based life.

#### Why Carbon?

- Bond energy between C and HNOPS are similar $\Rightarrow$ Bond change does not require a lot of energy.
- Links are quite stable.
- Wide range of double and triple bond configurations.

> Capacity to form chains with complex branching and networking of rings. Millions of possible 'organic' compounds can be formed.

$\Rightarrow$ Selection of elements is not random.

#### Alternatives?

What about Silicon?

- it is possible to make organo-silicon compounds
- complex chained compounds are also possible
- silicon forms stable compounds with oxygen (`SiO`)
  - binds to 4 oxygen atoms instead of 2
  - those atoms connect to others
  - VERY stable
  - ROCKS, not that good...
- there has been a lot of silicon chemistry, but no life has resulted of it
- while there's oxygen, silicon-based life is unlikely
- life on earth DOES use silicon
  - e.g. plants, for stability; spicules in sponges

#### Major classes of molecules

1. Proteins 
2. Sugars (structural support)
3. Lipids (membranes and energy)
4. Nucleic acids (information storage)

##### Proteins

- constructed from amino acids
- structural roles
- built by 'condensation' or 'dehydration synthesis' resulting in a peptide link
- charges in amino acids cause secondary and tertiary structure

Amino acids: 
- are chiral: identical structure, different orientation
  - L-amino acids
  - D-amino acids
  - based on rotation of light
- mirrored life might be possible

normally: L-amino acids, D-sugar
possibly: D-amino acids, L-sugar

##### Sugars

- used to store energy
- structural support
- build by dehydration reaction

##### Lipids

- long chains
- in membranes
- may store energy

##### Nucleic acids

- stores information
- made of ribose sugar, phosphate groub and base pairs
- complicated molecules by simple chemistry

> Meteorites contain amino acids and more...

### Life needs water

- medium for chemical reactions
- carries nutrients and energy supplies
- helps maintain thermal balance (self-regulation)

Advantages of water:
- can dissolve irons
- large heat capacity
- is cosmically abundant

#### Alternatives?

Ammonia:

- dissolves many chemicals
- potentially alows for ammonia-based bonds betwee chemicals similar to amino acids to make long chains
- less vicious than water 
- quite high heat vapourisation

Hydrogen fluoride:

- wide temperature range
- dissolves a wide range of substances

but
- rare
- very reactive and tends to destroy organic compounds

## What you need to know

- know the CHNOPS
- why carbon; why not silicon
- classes of biological molecules; uses
- chirality
- structure of DNA, what's RNA
- characteristics of water; alternatives

# Lecutre (4/5), September 27

## Fundamentals of Life

Where are universal structures in life?

### Cells

All life on earth is made of cells.

Made of
- membrane
 - increases pressure, makes chemistry possible
 - all living things have membranes (apart from viruses)
- information system
- energy system

#### Types of cells

Prokaryotes (no nucleus)
- bacteria and archaea
- $1-10\mu m$

Eukaryotes (nucleus)
- $10-100\mu m$
- nucleus to encapsule DNA
- organelles that compartmentalise

Most life is prokaryotic.
- Anthony van Leeuwenhoek discovered it 
- something like $10^30$
- microbes evolved, today's are different from the first ones
- they have complicated parts

$\Rightarrow$ We don't have any example of the most simple life!

#### Membranes

Phospholipids!

- Two differently polarized ends.
- Spontaneous arrangement in membrane structure.
- it will form a sphere-like object (minimization of surface tension)

This is not difficult to achieve; it can be done with molecules from Asteroids.

Two kinds: Gram negative and Gram positive.

Membrane needs to allow communcation and transfer of matter.

#### Peptidoglycan

A cell protecting 'mesh'.

Built out of D-amino acids. (Weird.)

#### DNA

Deoxyribonucleic acid

- double-helix structure
- encoding through bases
 - two pairs: A-T and G-C
 - replication through redundancy
- biology goes only from DNA to Proteins; never the other way


#### DNA vs RNA 

DNA | RNA
----|----
Double Stranded | Single Stranded
Deoxyribose sugar | Ribose Sugar
Bases: A G C T | Bases: A C G U

#### Transcription 

$DNA \rightarrow mRNA$

RNA Polymerase crates mRNA.

Function:
- Unwind DNA sequence.

#### Translation

$mRNA \rightarrow protein$

- Second stage of protein production
- using ribsomal RNA (rRNA) - very conserved type of RNA
- tRNA goes into Ribosome
 - complementary code of amino acid
 - 3 letters = 1 amino acids
 - codon = coding triplet of mRNA bases
- Genetic code = inventory of linkages between nucleotide triplets and the amino acids they code for
- A gene is a segment of DNA that is useful.
- there are 64 possible combinations
- yet, only twenty amino acids exist
- redundancy in DNA allows for tolerance of mutation/errors

## What you need to know

- major featurs of cells
- how membranes form and draw a basic membrane
- Understand that there are twoo different types of bacterial membrane
- Knw the difference between RNA and DNA
- Know what a ribosome is
- Understand and be able to explain transcription and translation
- Given a codon table, be able write DNA, RNA, protein sequences

## Phylogenetic Trees / Diversity of Life

All life on earth is related.

Two options:
- A rare event that resulted in us, thus we're special.
- A lot of different forms of life once existed, yet only one became dominant. 

What is LUCA? (Last Universal Common Ancestor)
- way simpler than todays life
- scientists tried to recreate it's proteins

### Classifying by resemblance

> "All cats look the same." (Aristotle)

This does not work for microbes.

### Terms

- **Phylogeny** is the evolutionary history of a species or group of related species.
- The discipline of **systematics** classifies organisms and determines their evolutionary relationships.
- **Taxonomy** is the ordered division and naming of organisms.

### System of species classification

- binomial nomenclature
- first part is the genus (e.g. "Canis" = dog)
- the second part, called the specific epithet, is unique for each species within the genus (e.g. "Lupus" => Wolf)

#### Hierarichal classification

- Species
- Genus
- Family
- Order 
- Class
- Phylum
- Kingdom
- Domain

#### Phylogenetic Trees

- Nodes: branching point
- Outgroup: Species that's very different to cluster other secies, one is interested in together
- Root: Last common ancestor of all the taxa
- Sister taxa: Taxa that are direct result of a node

Problm with phylogenies:
- looks can be deceiving
- similar species might have evolved in different parts of the world independently

$\Rightarrow$ Conversion evolution / Analogy.

e.g. Dolphins / Fish.

Homology can be distinguished from analogy by comparing fossil evidence and the degree of complexity.

How to create trees?

- ribosomes change only in small ways
- thus you can see the differences and similarities at the same time

#### Mutations

Over billions of years there will be change. Life cannot avoid the second law of thermal dynamics.

- Transversion
- Deletion
- Transition
- Insertionk

#### Methods today

Reverse engineering through observed rate of change with computer software.

Multiple trees are generated and occurences of certain relations indicate our confidence in the structure.

#### Sorting hormology from analogy

e.g. AGA -> AAA -> AGA

Mathematics allow you to compare the rest of the sequence.

> MATHEMATICS OF PHYLOGENETIC TREES ARE NO LONGER IN EXAMS.

### Evolutionary Hypotheses

- Type 1 Inference: Both ancestors have trait
- Type 2 Inference: One of the ancestors has trait
- Type 3 Inference: Neither has trait

### Complicating the tree of life

1. Microorganisms have encorporated others 
2. Bacteria can take up DNA from the environment
3. DNA can be injected into bacteria (i.e. viruses)
4. Microorganisms can transfer DNA

The tree of life is not as tidy as we'd wish; not as Darwin thought.

## What you need to know

- principles behind the hierarchical classification
- difference between homology and analogy
- know what a nonophyletic group is 
- how DNA is used to build PG trees
- understand horizontal gene transfer; give two examples
- know how to use pholygenetic trees to test hypothesis; example
- hypothetical implications of these ideas for the search of life elsewhere

# Lecture 7, September 30

> Energy and Life

## Definitions

- **Catabolism**: The processes by which a living organism obtains its energy and raw materials from nutrients.
- **Anabolism**: The processes by which energy and raw materials are used to build macromolecules and cellular structures.
- **Metabolism**: The processes of catabolism and anabolism.

Classification:
- Source of energy
- Source of carbon

Specifically:
- Photogrophs: can use light energy
- Chemeotrophs: must obtain energy from oxidation-reduction of chemical compounds
- Autotrophs: draw carbon from carbon dioxide
- Heterotrophs: carbon from organic compounds
- Mixotrophic: carbon can be obtained from both organic compounds and by fixing carbon dioxide

You may combine those. (e.g. Chemoautotrophs)

## Aerobic respiration

Terminal electron acceptor is oxygen.

$C_6 H_12 O_6 \rightarrow 6 CO_2 + 6 H_2 O$

- $C_6 H_12 O_6$: Electron donor
- $CO_2$: Electron acceptor

How do we get the energy from the reaction?

- energy from the free electron is used to move protons ($H^+$) out of a cell
- creates an osmotic gradient (differing concentrations inside/outside)
- proton moves back through ATP synthase
- $ADP + P \rightarrow ATP$

$\Rightarrow$ Energy from the electron is captured in a chemical bond.

## Anaerobic respiration

Terminal electron acceptor is something other than oxygen:

- Nitrate ($NO_3^-$) e.g. Pseudomonas, Bacillus
- Sulfate ($SO_4^{2-}$) e.g. Desulfovibrio
- $CO_2$

## Chemolithotrophy

Very interesting because **donors** are inorganic compounds.

- $H_2 S$
- $H_2$ 
- $NH_4^+$
- $Fe^{2+}$

Iron-oxidation is *just* thermodynamically favourable.

$\Delta G^0=-29 \frac{kJ}{mol}$ ... Life on the edge!

Waste: regular structures

## Photosynthesis

Electrons come from water. But more energy is needed (from the sun) to make them energetic.

## Thermodynamics and Life

$\Delta G^0 =\sum G^0(products) - \sum G^0(reactants)$

## Reduction and Oxidation

An atom becomes more reduced when it undergoes a chemical reaction in which it...
- Oxidation: gains
- Reduction: loses
...electrons.

Reactions can be written as half-reactions:
- Electron donor $\rightarrow$ compound + $e^-$
- Electron acceptor + $e^-$ $\rightarrow$ compound

## An Electron Tower

- a redox reaction needs a reducin and oxidizing half-reaction
- reactions with stronger tendency to give up electrons are higher (more negative) on the tower
- to determine which direction the reactions go, see which is "higher" on the electron tower

## What you need to know

- what the electron transfer chain is
- what chemiosmosis is and how it works
- what anaerobic respiration is, what chemolithotroph is and

# Lecture 7 + 8, October 04

## Life in extremes 

Life is limited by physical and chemical extremes. (temperature, radiation, pressure, pH, ...)

Edges are dominated by microbes. 
- easier to adapt a single cell to extreme conditions

### Why do we care? 

- Informs us about the limits of the biosphere. What is the human impact?
- Fundamental insights into the biochemical architecture of life.
- Are there useful products that we can get from these environments?
- It defines the boundaries of haitability and thus the prospects for life elsehwere.

### What kind of extremophiles do we have?

- frog from North America that can freeze in the winter (lithobates sylvaticus)
- Tardigrades: can be heated to 151 C to - 200 C
- they can withstand vacuum and more than 1,200 times atmospheric pressure
- they can survive in a dry state for nearly 10 years
- they can withstand a thousand times more ionizing radiation than other animals and are highly resistant to shortwave UV radiation

Major targets of dysfunction at extremes:
- proteins, lipids, DNA

#### Hot environments

- thermophiles (50 - 80 C)
- hyperthermophiles (80+ C)
- maximum recorded 122 C

Life NEEDS these temperatures.

Challenges
- breakdown of molecules
- increased membrane fluidity

Adaptations
- thermostable proteins and enzymes
- modify cell compositio

#### Freezing temperatures

- psychrophilic

Challenges
- membrane damage from ice
- decreased membrane fluidity
- availability of liquid water

Adaptations
- membrane composition
- antifreeze agents

#### The cell memebrane

Problem:
- fatty acids solidfy in the cold (cf. butter)

Solution:
- unsaturated fatty acids
- there are holes in the membrane, which make them more fluid (cf. vegetable oil)

#### Saline and try conditions

- halophilic (15-37% NaCl)
- xerophilic (draught-tolerant)

Challenges
- osmotic pressure and water availability
- membrane inegrity

Adaptations
- controlling water loss from cells
- cell dormancy

#### Extremes of pH

- acidophiles (pH 0.4-4) and alkaliphiles (pH 8-12.5)

Challenges
- breakdown of cellular components
- limitations to metabolic processes

#### High pressure

- piezophilic : up to 130 times atmospheric pressure

Challenges
- tight packing of molecules and loss of fluidity
- impaired cellular structures and activities

Solution
- unsaturated fatty acids

#### Extremes of Radiation

- up to 100000 Gy (Deinococcus radiodurans)

Adaptations
- multiple genome copies
- effective DNA repair mechanism
- pigments to quench reactive oxygen states

#### Energy and Extreme Environments

In general, where there are more extremes, then organisms need more energy yielding reactions as they require this energy to deal with damage.

## Celestial mechanics

### Celestial Sphere

- ecliptic is the path the sun follows as it appears to circle the celestial sphere
- the celestial equator is a projection of the equator on space

### Geocentric model

- could explain a number of observations 
    - the nightly rotation of stars
    - the simple motion of the planets
    - the lack of motion of the stars relative to each other
    - phases of the moon
- could not explain
    - retrograde motion
    - why venus and mars stayed close to the sun

### The heliocentrical model

by Copernicus

- outer planets are slower than inner ones; appear to go backward

### Synodic and siderial periods

- sidereal period (P): time to complete one orbit of the sun with respect to the stars
- synodic period (S): time to return to the same position in the sky relative to the sun as seen from earth

$P^{-1}=E^{-1}-P^{-1}$ (for outer planets)

$S^{-1}=P^{-1}-E^{-1}$ (for inner planets)

### Keplers laws

1. The orbit of each planit is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.
2. The radius vector to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal time.
3. The squares of the sidereal periods of the planets orbits are proportional to the cubes of the semimajor axes of their orbits. ($P^2=ka^3$)

### Newtons laws

1. An object moves at a constant velocity if there is no net force acting upon it.
2. $\vec F = m \vec a$
3. For every force, there is an equal but opposite reaction force.

### Centripetal Force

$F=\frac{mv^2}{r}$

### Newtons law of universal Gravitation

$F=\frac{GMm}{r^2}$

## What to know?

- what extremophiles are
- give at least two examples of an adaptation to an extreme and the biochemical basis
- know an example of how membrane changes can allow for adaptations
- be able to explain why extremophiles are useful for assessing the habitability of other planetary bodies
- know why chemolithotrophs are generally extremophiles
- know why the study of extremophiles has practical industrial uses (+example)
- why microbes, and particularly extremophiles, might be useful in human space exploration
- see slides

# Lecture 9

## Waves

$h = h_0 sin(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}(x-vt))$

$f=\frac{v}{\lambda}$

## Small angle formula

if $r >>d$, then $\alpha \approx sin(\alpha) \approx tan(\alpha)$

## Doppler effect

$\lambda_0(1 + \frac{v_r}{c})$

$\Rightarrow \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} = \frac{v_r}{c}$

## Quantum nature of light

Problem: photoelectric effect

$E=hf$

Energy of an electron: $E(n)=-\frac{2\pi^2me^4k^2Z^2}{n^2h^2}$

For Hydrogen: $E(n)=\frac{2\pi^2me^4k^2}{n^2h^2}=-\frac{R'}{n^2}$

therefore: $\Delta E = E(n) - E(m) = R'(\frac{1}{n^2}-\frac{1}{m^2})$ (energy released when an electron falls from $n$ to $m$)

## Excitation of Atoms

- radioactive: absorption of a photon
- collisional: free particle collides with atom, gives of kinetic energy

## Wien's displacement law

$\lambda_{max}=\frac{2.898\times10^-3 m\cdot K}{T}$

## Flux energy

per square meter per second: $F=\sigma T^4$

Total energy output per unit time of a star is: $L=4\pi R^2\sigma T^4$

## Kirchhoff's three laws of spectroscopy

1. A hot and opaque solid, liquid or highly compressed gas emits a continuous spectrum.
2. A hot, transparent gass produces a spectrum of emission lines.
3. A cools, transparent gass in front of a hotter source of a continuous spectrum creates absorption lines.

## What you need to know

- regions of EM spectrum
- $c=f\lambda$
- small angle formula
- understand and use doppler effect (look at how to derive this?)
- understand quantum nature of light
- difference absoption line and emission line
- know blackbody and it's properties
- know Kirchhoff's three laws

# Lecture 11, October 7

## The sun

Closest star to earth

- $T=5800K$
- $R=695000km$ ($=108 R_{e}$)
- $M=1.988\times10^30kg$ ($=333000 M_{e}$)
- 98% hydrogen and helium, 2% heavier elements

Fairly active.

## The solar system

large number of boides in orbit:
- Planets
- Asteroids
- Comets
- Kuiper belt objects
- Oort cloud

About 100 AU in size

## What is a solar system planet?

- Planet vs Star: nuclear fusion vs reflection
- IAU definition: 
  - orbits the sun
  - mass causes it to be spherical
  - has cleared its neighbourhootd of other bodies 

## Solar system planets

eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
five dwarf planets: Ceres, Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake

## Planetary orbits and rotation

- direction of orbit the same
- orbital plane close to the ecliptic
- direction of rotation the same, except Uranus and Venus

## Types of planets

two basic types:

1. inner, rocky/terrestrial planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars
2. outer gaseous/icy planets (Jovian): Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune

## Satellites/Moons

all planets except Mercury and Venus have satellites

- Earth: Moon
- Jupiter and Saturn: 79 and 62 respectively
- Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto
- some Jovian satellites are larger than Mercury
- orbital planes and directions are similar to planets

## Rings

- all 4 Jovian planets have rings
- made of small particles, mainly water ice 
- regular collisions cause Saturn's ring to be very thin
- satellites cause gaps (neighbourhood/resonance)

## Asteroids

- small rocky bodies
- most orbit the sun in Asteroid belt
- irregular shapes
- largest may be few 100 km in size

## Comets

- small balls of dust and ice that orbit the Sun
- highly elliptical orbits
- short period: coplanar, Kuiper belt
- long period: all directions, Oort cloud
- long tails

## Comet tails

three tails:
- plasma, swept radially by the solar wind (fast)
- dust, sunlight/radiation pressure (slow)
- trail of pebble size particles; cause meteor showers

## Meteorites

- rocky object that can reach the ground
- primitive: remnants of the birth of the solar system
- processed: part of larger object that has processed the primitive material

some from Moon or Mars: ejected by collisions, Panspermia!

## Kuiper belt

- ring of material 30-50AU from the Sun
- 100000 bodies bigger than 100km
- short period comets
- Pluto, Eris, Huamea, Makemake

## Oort cloud

- more than one tail
- information about outer Solar System
- know what a meteor shower is


# High mass stars

## General information

- $M > 8M_Sun$
- reach the main-sequence in less than 150000 years
- much higher temperatures
- higher fusion rate
- CNO cycle rather than p-p-chain
- 12C + H, 13N, 13C, 14N+H, 15O, 15N, 15N+H-4He, 12C
- hydrogen burnt in a few billion years
- Luminosity $L$ is proportional (roughly) to $M^4$
- much (factor 1000) shorter lifetime

## Becoming a super giant

- behaves like a low mass star, only much faster
- hydrogen burning in shell around helium core
- no helium flash, thermal pressure remains high
- helium burning only lasts only a few hundred thousdan years
- core temperature reaches 600 million K - C fusion starts
- fusion of heavier elements is possible

## Advanced nuclear burning

- simplest are helium capture reactions: helium for heavier elements
- if the core temperature is high enough, heavy nuclei may fuse together
- multiple shell burning
    - burns element
    - core shrinks, temperature rises
    - burning starts again
    - up until iron
- H, He, C, O, Ne, Mg, Si, Fe

## H-R Life tracks

- fusion ceases -> shell burning intesifies, volume increases
- core flares up, core contracts

## THe problem with iron

- iron has the lowest mass per nucleon
- lighter than iron -> fusion
- heavier than iron -> fission
- when the core is filled with iron, the star dies

## Death of a hight mass star

- core is intially supported by degeneracy pressure
- protons and electrons combine to neutrons, releasing neutrinos
- iron core collapses into a ball of neutrons just a few kilometers across
- neutron degeneracy pressure
- collapse releases an enormous amount of energy; Supernova
- neutron core remains as a neutron star 
- if mass is high enough, gravity might overcome neutron degeneracy pressure -> black hole 

## Supernova properties

- expansion of outer layers with high velocity (10000km/s)
- extreme luminosity of gas (10 billion Suns for about a week)
- reason unclear

## Supernova nucleosynthesis

- supernovae can create elements higher than iron
- released neutrons form neutron rich nuclei
- unstable nuclei decay via beta decay, releasin electrons, forming higher elements

1. big bang: H, He, Li
2. everhting > C formed through nucleosynthesis
3. <= Fe -> High mass stars

# Intermediate mass stars

- intially they behave like high mass stars
- during the supergiant phase, degeneracy pressure prevents their cores from reaching high enough temperatures
- end their life as low mass stars

# Evidence for the origin of the elements

- older stars contains smaller amounts of heavy elements
- helium capture reactions add two protons at a time; consistent with abundance of elements in solar system (therefore universe?)
- less heavier elements

Another possibility: Merging neutron stars

> ALL THE ELEMENTS FOR LIFE FORMED THROUGH STELLAR NUCLEARSYNTHESIS!

## What you need to know

- masses of high, low and intermediate mass stars
- high mass -> very short lifetime
- burning steps of stars
- core fusion stops at iron
- supernova occurs, core remains => heavier elements

# The formation of the solar system

## Dynamics

- orbital directions of planets and rotation of sun the same
- orbits are coplanar
- the planets orbits are very nearly circular
- similar rotation
- planets orbital distances are regularly spaced

## The birth of the solar system

- big bang: just H, He, Li, Be
- the sun and planets formed from a cloud of gas and dust (Solar Nebular Theory)

## Solar Nebula

- cloud of gas and dust
- angular momentum causes it to spin faster as it collapses
- Sun forms in the centre, Planets form in the disc.
- angular momentum stops the cloud from collapsing entirely.

## Jeans Mass

- mass required can be determined by comparing gravitational and thermal energies

$E_G \approx \frac{3GM^2}{5R}$

$E_th = \frac{3}{2}NkT=\frac{3MkT}{2m_H}$

$E_G > 2E_th \Leftrightarrow M > \frac{5kT}{Gm_H}$

$M_J = \left(\frac{5kT}{Gm_H})^{\frac{3}{2}}\left(\frac{3}{4\pi\rho})^{\frac{1}{2}}$

## Disc formation

- cloud contains contains some angular momentum
- specific angular momentum $\vec J = \vec r \times \vec v \approx rv$
- at some point $v$ increases sufficietly to halt collapse
- centripetal force matches gravitational force
$r=\frac{J^2}{GM}$

## Star formation theory

### Class 0

$T \approx 10000 a$
$R \approx 10000 AU$
$\frac{dM}{dt}\approx 10^{-4}$.... see slides

## Disc lifetimes

- about 5-10 million years 
- young stars have infrared excess
- older stars do not, generally speaking, have an infrared excess
- therefore (gas-)planets have to form quickly

## Planet formation in a disc

- disc forms early during star formation
- solids condense out to form grains
- grains collide and grow
- largest planetesimals sweep up smaller ones
- large ones attract gas atmosphere
- small ones either don't have enough gravity to attract gas or formed too late

## Escape velocity

With $\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \geq \frac{GMm}{R}$ we can define $v_esc =\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$.

The gravitational impact parameter $S$ is bigger than the geometric radius $S=R(1+\frac{v^2_esc}{v^2_0})$

Thus, objects can grow very quickly once they reach a certain mass.

## Snow/Frost line

- disc heated by radiation from central protostar
- temperature decreses with radius $F=\frac{L}{4\pid^2}$

## Terrestrial vs Jovian

- increase in particle density beyond the snowline due to condensation of ices
- accretion rate
- planetary bodies can grow more quickly outside the frost line
- within the frost line the cores are smaller and form later

## Jovian planets 

- predominantly H and He
- must form before gas disappears
- form beyond the frost line

## Terrestrial planets

- total formation time may be as long as 100 Myr

## Asteriods and comets 

- remnants of planet building
- asteroid belt
    - between Mars and Jupiter
    - resonance with Jupiter ejects asteroids from belt

## Radiocative decay

half life: $T\lambda = ln2$

# What you need to know

- understand Jeans mass
- understand angular momentum conservation
- understand gravitational focusing
- know what the frost line is (and why Jovian and terrestrial have to do with it)
- be able to determine age of solar system given K and Ar ration and half-life

# Extrasolar planets

## Finding them

- very faint
- far away 

Problem: Finding faint objects next to bright objects

## Astrometry

- all objects in a planetary system orbit their common centre of mass (com)

$\vec r_com = \sum_i \frac{m_i\vec r_i}{M}$

- for sun $r_com$ is $0.005AU$
- to obeserve the movement of a sun like star we need a MUCH better telescope

Solution: Doppler effect (Doppler technique)

## Finding masses

$M_Sv_S=M_Pv_P\Rightarrow M_P = \frac{M_Sv_S}{v_P}$

The planets average velocity must be: $v_P=\frac{2\pi a_P}{P_P}$
Therefore $M_P=\frac{M_Sv_SP_P}{2\pi a}$

## Inclination

- the amount of Doppler shift depends on the inclination of the orbit
- $M_{measured}=M_P sin i$

## Transit method

- if a planet moves between us and its parent star it will block some starlight
- amount blocked tells us the radius of the planet
- if we can calculate the period we cdan determine the mass accurately

## Getting the radius

fraction of light blocked $\approx\frac{R^2_P}{R^2_S}$

## Gravitational lensing

### Micro lensing

- foreground star can gravitationally focus liht from a background star
- if the foreground star has an orbiting planet this may produces anomaly
- can detect low mass planets

Problem: Stars and plents have to be reasonably distant

### Direct imaging

- if the host star is not very bright it is sometimes possible to directly image the planet
- until recently impossible

### HR 8799

- angular differential imaging
- turning off rotation of telescope
- allows to substract telescope noise

## Exoplanet properties 

- hot Jupiters exist
- a lot of eccentric orbits
- medium mass planets are very common (between Earth and Neptune)

## Combining transit & radial velocity

transit: radius

radial velocity: planet mass

radial velocity | transit
----------------|--------
Period          | Period
Semimajor Axis  | Semimajor Axis
Mass (minimum)  | Radius
Eccentricity    |

=> density

## What you need to know

- Astrometry
- radial velocity/Doppler
- transit technique
- microlensing
- why not Earth?
- why hot Jupiters?

# Habitability

## The habitable zone

- range of distances from a star (e.g. the Sun) within which we could move our planet without fundamentally changing its ability to support life
- generally the zone which makes it possible to have liquid water
- is not equivalent to habitability, just a good start
- the zone moves because the energy emitted by a star changes over time

## Terrestrial planets

- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars 
-located between 0.4 and 1.52 AU

## Interiors

- differentiation
    - core: densest material
    - mantle: rocky material of modest density (e.g. silicon and oxygen)
    - crust: lowest density rocks (e.g. granite, basalt)
    - litosphere: crust + upper mantle

## How do we know?

- earthquakes produces two types of waves
    - P waves (longitudonal)
    - S waves (transverse)
- molten outer core stops S waves, but allows P waves through
- analysis of seismic waves allows us to develop a model of the Earths interior 

## Geological activity

- primary driver: interior heat
- heat of accretion: accreting planetesimals release gravitational potential energy
- heat from differentiation: dense material sinks, ...
- heat from radioactivity: energy released through decay

## How do Planets cool

...

## Why is this important?

- volcanic outgassing
- tectonic motion (plate tectonics)
- semi-molten core drives currents producing a magnetic field

## Surface area to volume ratio

- smaller r means more surface compared to volume
- thus small planets cool slower

## Surface temperatures

Flux at a distance $r_p$: $F_P = \left(\frac{R_*}{r_p}\right)\sigma T_*^4$

Subsolar temperature: $T_{SS} = \left(\frac{R_*}{r_P})^{1/2}T_*$

Remember: This is not accurate... because:
- earth is a sphere: differing absorption
- has atmosphere, Earth reflects 30% of incoming radiation

Better formula for Earth: $\frac{E}{\delta t}=\pi R_p^2(1-A)F_p = (1-A)\pi R^2_P\left(frac{R_*^2}{r_P}\right)\sigma T^4_*$

Assumption: Energy radiated = Energy absorbed
$(1-A)\pi R^2_P\left(frac{R_*^2}{r_P}\right)\sigma T^4_*=4\pi R^2_p\sigma T^4_P$

Therefore we get -18 C, which is the effective energy released into space. (Effective temperature.)

## Atmosphere

- layer of gas surrounding a planet
- consists of many gases
- generally thin around terrestrial planets
    - within 10km of surface
- ...

## Sources of atmospheric gases

- volcanic outgassing
- evaporation or sublimation of surface liquid and ices
- micrometeorites and high energy particles

## The loss of atmospheric gases

- condensatin
- chemical reactions
- impacts
- solar wind
- thermal escape

## Importance of atmospheres

- breathing
- absorbs and scatters light
- creates wind and weather
- interaction with magnetic fields can create magnetosphere
- greenhouse effect (warmer surface than without atmosphere)

## Greenhouse effect

- sun emits visible light
- planet emits infrared
- atmosphere is opaque to infrared
- slows energy loss
- does not change energy budget

## Thermal escape from an atmosphere

- average kinetic energy per particle of mass $m$:
$\left<KE\right> =\frac{1}{2} m \left<v^2\right>=\left(\frac{3kT}{m})^{1/2}$
- the most common speed for a gas particle is known as the peak thermal velocity
- the escape speed from a planet is $v_esc = \sqrt{\frac{2GM_P}{R_P}}$

Therfore $v_esc > 10 v_th$. (So the particles don't escape the planet.)

## Retaining an atmosphere

> See diagram in slides.

## PHE (Potentially Habitable Exoplanets)

## Habitability around lower-mass stars

- the habitable zone is closer to stars with masses less than that of the Sun (tidally locked)
- emit longer wavelength radiation (implications for processes like photosynthesis)

## WYNTK

- what is the habitable zone
- internal heat: how acquire/lose? why important?
- ability to determine surface temperatures (stellar temperature, radius, planet's orbital radius and albedo)
- atmospheres: how acquire/lose? why important?
- thermal escape from an atmosphere
- how potential habitability changes around stars different to the Sun

# Astrochemistry

## Why study of astrochemistry?

- concerned with production, distribution and fate of the chemical precursors of life
- information about how the Universe went from simple beginnings to supporting life
- knowledge of how prebiotic molecules may have formed
- wether molecules of life are universal

> Essential discovery was that complex molecules can exist in space!

## How to find molecules: Emission spectra 

When photons are produced by an energised gas, elemental or molecular

## Great complexity

Over 300 molecules have now been observed in space.

How?
- Low temperatures mean no thermal activation.
- Low pressure mean no collisional activation.

## In the beginning

early Universe was chemically simple:

- hydrogen and deuterium
- Helium 3 and 4
- ...

## Many reactions involve protons and elecrons

...

## The Universe is not homogeneous

Diffuse Interstellar Clouds
- cold (90-100K)
- very dilute ($10^2 cm^{-3}$)
- clouds mostly atomic
- some hot regions where photoionisation occurs
- clouds permeated by UV radiation
- few simple diatomics

Giant Molecular Clouds
- $T \approx 10-50 K$
- $n \approx 10^5 - 10^7 cm^{-3}$
- material is mostly molecular
- $m\approx 1$ solar masses
- size $\approx 50 pc$
- can form thousands of low mass stars 

Protoplanetary disk
- thin accretion disks from which protonstar forms
- inflow from large radii (100 AU) onto central protostar
- T on the outside: 10 K
- $n(H_2) \approx 10^{10} - 10^{15} cm^{-3}$

Carbon rich stars
- chemistry near photosphere makes simple molecules ($CO$, $N_2$, $HCN$, $C_2H_2$)
- carbonaceaous dust made in this type of object

> Know one!

## The importance of grains

BUT there is a problem:
- gas phase reactions just don't explain the abundance of molecules
- Low temperatures make chemistry difficult
- Low pressure make interactions between ions and molecules rare
- Another way to bring molecules together is required.

## Interstellar grains

- siliceous and carbonaceous material
- convered my ice
- size of about $1\mu m$
- molecules can accumulate on surface, thus overcoming the proximity problem
- surface can be heated by solar energy, thus overcoming the temperature problem

## Reactions on grains

- Eley-Rideal reactions
- Langmuir-Hinshelwood reactions
- Hot atom reaction

## PAHs (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons)

- stable, made mostly of carbon rings
- make up 10-15% of galactic carbon
- abundant in meteorites
- can act as a scaffold to form other compounds
- under oxidising conditions can react to form quinones and other molecules found in life

## The cosmic abundance of water

- there has been a lot of water around for a long time
...

## What you need to know

- how we detect organics in space using spectroscopy
- the structure and importance of interstellar grains in organic chemistry
- the importance of radiation in driving chemical reactions
- one example of a location in space where organic compounds can be found and a basic description of the characteristics of these locations
- know what PAHs are and thei relevance
- understand generally why the discovery of interstellar organic chemistry is important in our understanding of the possible origins of life. 

# The first billion years of earth

## Why the first billion?

Major features were already established.

Period where Mars had liquid water.

## Formation of Sun

- Formation of Universe: 13.7 billion years
- Formation of Galaxy: 11 billion years
- Formation of Solar System: 4.6 billion years 
- Sun is probably a third generation star
- Probably takes 10-100 million years for planets to form 

## Formation of the Earth

- after initial accreation, temperatures at depths of 400 to 800 km below the Earth's surface reach the melting point of iron
- Earth developed inner and outer core, a mandtle and a crust
- How long did this take? About 50 million years.

## Composition of the Earth

Whole Earth:
- Iron 35%
- Oxygen 30%
- Silicon 15%
- Magnesium 13%

Crust:
- ...

## Formation of Solar System

- much evicence from meteorites
- most come from asteroids

...

## Formation of the Moon

- no other planet has such a large moon relative to its size
- Moon has only a very small iron core
- Moon has a bulk density about the same as the Earth's matnle
- Highly depleted in highly volatile elements
- has identical oxygen isotope composition
- Earth and Moon probably have a shared history.

Giant Impact Hypothesis:
- collision with mars size object
- Earth material would have gone into orbit and formed Moon
- Moon is leaving Earth.
- Moon was a lot bigger in the beginning.

Sources of Heat:
- Collisions
- Compression
- Radioactivity od elements

The Oceans
- vapor from inside of the earth
- comets might be major source of water (isotopes don't match, though)
- water rich asteroids (isotopes match)

## The rock record

Oldest known rocks are about 4 billion years old (Zircons)
- have to be formed in liquid water (therefore it must have been there)

## Early Atmosphere

- start with H and He
- could not hold these light gases (escape velocity)
- volcanic outgassing becan to create thicker atmosphere  composed of wide variety of gases
- most of atmosphere: early catascrophic degassing, rest: continual degassing
- by human standards very poisonous
- UV radiation damage was about 1000 times higher (no oxygen $\to$ no ozone)

## The late heavy Bombardment

- Mare orientale (crater on the back of the moon)
- around 3.2-3.9 billion years ago

## One theory (real 'spikes')

- intially had large population of icy objects beyond Saturn
- in stable orbits around the Sun
- as these planets grew their gravitational attraction began to scatter the remaining planetesimals
- a small fraction crashed into the Moon and rocky plents making immense crates
- calculation suggest that the bombardment would have lasted less than 100 million years

## Consequences

Root of the pholygenetic tree contains a lot of hyperthermophiles. Assumption: Early life had to be able to life in extreme heat during/after asteroid impacts.

## 3.8 Ga ago

- liquid water
- ...

## WYNTK

- describe differentiation
- describe the basic ideas behind origin of the moon
- describe basic theories for the origin of the Earth's oceans
- ...

# The origin of Life

## Definition of Life

- A self-sustained chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution.
- Life is what happens to matter when it gets old. (?)

Problem:
- All the characteristics of life may be attributes of non-living things.
- Not all living things have all the attributes.
- e.g. Rabits who can't reproduce on their own.

Therefore:
- we have working definitions
- we need to keep an open mind for life as we "don't know it"
- we can study the structure of most life forms


## The Urey-Miller experiment

Energy + Gases + Water -> Amino acids

Therefore there is no complicated part to make the building blocks of life.

## Building blocks of life in meteorites

- Amino acids
- several hundred of organic molecules
- nucleobases
- nonanoic and decanoic acids (form membranes)

Significance:
- membranes and replicating RNA molecules might have created protocell 

## The RNA world theory 

- RNA can be enzymes, called ribozyme
- ribozymes can catalyze RNA synthesis
- therefore, RNA might have been the first molecule to reproduce
- diversity is possbile due to "mutations" (e.g. cause by zinc)

Therefore RNA might have been the start of life.

## From molecule to cell

- membranes and replicating RNA might have formed evolutionary unit
- molecules in the membrane might interact
- presumably at some point, a replicating cell emerged (very simple) ... LIFE!

## Current unknowns

- What came first? Protein or nucleic acids? (A lot of debates!); False division?
- What did the first living cell look like?

## Basic requirements

1. An energy source
2. A means of concentrating molecules
3. An environment conducive to complex molecules and their assembly

## Potential locations

### Hydrothermal vents 

- today there are many microbes to be found
- additionally a lot of worms and crabs

Ferrodoxin:
- is a very ancient iron-sulfur protein
- electron transfer agent using the change in valence state of the iron
- can use $Fe_2S_2$ or $Fe_3S_4$

The iron-sulfur world hypothesis:
- assumes formation of simple organic molecules from simple inorganic gases (CO, CO2, HCN, H2S)
- reactions at surface of iron-nickel-sulfur mineral particles (as in black smoker)

$CO + H_2S + 2H_2 \to CH_3SH+ H_2O$

Catalyzed reaction to methyl ester of thioacetic acid:

$CH_3SH + CO \to CH_3COSCH_3 + H_2S$

Reactions with $H_2O$ and $NH_3$ yield carboxylic acids and amides:

$CH_3COSCH+H_2O \to CH_3COOH + CH_3SH$
$CH_3COSCH+NH_3 \to CH_3CONH_2 + CH_3SH$

Acids may react with amonia to produce amino acids.

Surface gives environment for reactions of $HCN$ (and others) to yield precursors to the nucleobases.

### Others

#### Impact craters

- crater of 25 km diameter: hydrothermal system for 10k years
- crater of 250 km diameter: hydrothermal system for 1M years
- heating from the impact, hydrothermal circulation

#### Beaches

- tides concentrate molecules in rocks

#### Volcanic hot springs

- literally a warm pond
- geothermal energy
- concentration of molecules

#### In bubbles

1. Volcanic activity under water -> bubbles containing gasses rise
2. Concentrated gasses form organic compounds in bubbles
3. Release into atmosphere
4. UV radiation causes formation of complex organics
5. molecules fall back into ocean in rain

## The common origin

Phylogentic tree suggest one LUCA. Therefore only one place of origin.

> Other reasons?

## Origin on another planet?

> Panspermia

Travel of life through space
1. Ejection from planet
2. Transfer through space
3. Transit through atmosphere
4. Conditions for growth at landing site

## Isotopes

Same element, different neutron count.

Many elements have two or more stable isotopes.

### Fractionation

Separation and concentration of same isotopes.

Why?
1. Difference in bond strenghts. Lighter isotopes react faster -> In products.
2. Unidirectional reactions
3. Lower temperature means more impact of chemical differences.

How?

$\delta^{13}C = \frac{c_{sample} - c_{std}}{c_{std}}$

## Isotopic, morphological and biomarker evidence

isotopic:
- much less 13C in organics
- in mantle: $\delta = -0.002$ in organic carbon and $\delta = 0$ in inorganic rocks
- proportions fluctuate; recorded in sedimentary record

morphological:
- filamentous structures in rocks, which could resemble life
- at best an ambiguous indicator of biognicity
- does not prove biological processes

## Complications of finding life in early rocks

???

## Laboratory work

## Relation to finding life elsewhere

# Geological History of the Earth

## Interior Layers

Not unusual, differentiation.

Crust: 20-90km thick (continents), 5-10 km thick (ocean)
Mantle: 83% of volume, periodite, rich in iron and magnesium
Core: Solid inner region, liquid outer region; iron and small amount of nickel

Lithosphere: Crust and upper mantle
Asthenosphere: part of upper mantle, behaves plastically and slowly flows

## Plate tectonic theory

Crust made up of plates. 

Heat and matter exchange between inner and outer planet moves them.

If we need hydrothermal vents for life, how can there be life on a planet without plate tectonics?

Influence on geological sciences:
- revolutionary concept
- provides framework for
    - interpreting aspects of Earth on a global scale
    - relating seemingly unrelated phenomena
    - interpreting Earth history

Implications:
- mountain building
- arrangement of continents affects solar heating and cooling and thus winds and weather systems
- rapid plate spreading and hot-spot activity may release volcanic carbon dioxide and affect global climate
- continental arrangement affects ocean currents
- recycles elements of nutrients (necessary for life?)
- movement of continents creates corridors or barriers to migration

## Rock cycle

- the rock cycle is a pictorial representation of evenets leading to the origin, destruction, change and reformation of rocks
- 3 types
    - igneous
    - sedimentary
    - metamorphic

Evidence of life on early earth is therefore destroyed by the rock cycle. 
While looking for life, scientists should pay attention to rock cycles.

## Attempts to date Earth

James Hutton (late 1700s): Uniformitarianism (whatever processes occur today, also occured in the past)
e.g.
- Salt in Ocean
- Sediment Thickness
Problem: Rates are variable

## How old are rocks?

1. Relative dating: older or younger than other rocks?
2. Absolute dating: radiometric dating

### Absolute

Radioisotopes are trapped in minerals when they crystallize. 

They decay through time and form stable isotopes.

Based on parent and daughter isotopes as well as the original ratio you can calculate how long the isotopes have been decaying.

### Relative

Principle of Superposition:
Rock layer above is younger than the ones below it.

Principle of Original Horizontality:
Rock layers are originally formed in approximately horizontal orientation.

Principle of Crosscutting Relationships:
Any feature that cuts across rocks is younger than the youngest rock that is cut.

Principle of Funal Succession:
Animals go extinct over time.

### Geological time scales

- in Victorian England
- Eons and super-eons
- in pre-cambrian time there were only microbes
- cambrian explosion: a lot of animal-like creatures can be seen in the rock record
- mesozoic era: reptile era, one single continent
- cenozoic: age of mammals, earth as we know it

## What you need to know 

- major parts of Earths interior
- basic idea of plate tectonics

# The great oxidation event

## What is it?

- increase in oxygen around 2.5 Ga

Today about 21 percent of the atmosphere is oxygen, a lot more than in the early days of the Earth.

## Geological proxies

A proxy is a measured variable to infer a variable of interest.

E.g. air bubbles in ice for oxygen abundance for past 1 million years.
E.g. rock record for abundance of oxygen abundance further back in Earths history.

### Mineral deposits

Rocks deposited by flowing water have necessarily been in contact with the atmosphere.

These minerals show low oxygen concentration in their environment of formation:
- Pyrite (<0.1% PAL)
- Uraninite (<0.01% PAL)
- Siderite (<0.001% PAL)

Most of the rocks on early earth were not in contact with oxygen.

### Mobilization of redox sensitive elements

Some elements are soluble in only one oxidation state.
- Iron and manganese soluble when reduced
- Uranium and molybdenum soluble when oxidised

1. Soils older than 2.4 Ga are significantly depleted in iron relative to those younger than 1.8 Ga.
   <br> $\Rightarrow$ Sudden change of oxidation state of iron between 2.4 Ga - 1.8 Ga
2. Sudden massive accumulation of manganese in ocean sediments around 2.2 Ga

### Seasonal changes of minerals

Banded Iron Formations formed intermittently when iron was oxidised.
<br> $\Rightarrow$ suggests atmosphere had low levels of oxygen but surface of oceans became periodically oxidised, perhaps seasonally.

Rarely found after 2.4 Ga when the oceans were widely oxidised.

### Elements and their isotopes

Banded Iron Formations
- record changes in elements other than iron
- chromium is oxidised from $Cr^{3+}$ to $Cr^{6+}$ and at the same time it becomes fractionated
- fractionated $Cr$ isotope data indicate accumulation of $Cr^{6+}$ in ocean surface water approximately $2.8$ to $2.6 Ga$ ago (before the first rise of oxygen)
- in $1.88 Ga$ old BIFs $Cr$ isotopes are not fractioanted, indicating a decline in atmospheric oxygen.
- Maybe fluctuating levels of oxygen around the Great Oxidation event?

### Look at sulfur isotope fractionation

Different sulfur isotopes in different minerals.

Mass independent fractionation of sulfur requires lack of oxygen and ozone in atmosphere. 
<br> $\Rightarrow$ disappearance of this mass independent fractionation after about 2.4 Ga ago is interpreted as appearance of oxygen

## Source of oxygen on early earth

Photosynthesis: $6CO_2 + 6H_2O \to C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$

Was around BEFORE GOE.

Sinks of oxygen
- oxidation of volcanic gases
- oxidation of dead organic material

## Why did oxygen rise so suddenly?

A few ideas:
1. Change in mantle gases being produced
   - continet stabilisation period 2.7 Ga
   - volcanism became partly land based
   - decrease of submarine volcanism lead to rise in oxygen
   - problem: not strong enough to really account for change
2. Change in marine nutrient supply
   - Phosphorus is an important nutrient for cyanobacteria
   - Phosphorus is often lost by adsoption onto iron oxides in the oceans
   - Too much Phosphorus for the available iron $\Rightarrow$ Rise in Phosphorus levels $\Rightarrow$ more oxygen production by cyanobacteria
3. Decrease in methane
   - mantle had cooled down, eruption of less Ni-rich rocks
   - Ni relevant for methane producing microbes (methanogens)
   - Less Ni, less effective methane production
   - less reactions of methane with atmospheric oxygen
4. Swtich between two feedback stabilised steady states dependent on atmospheric life time of oxygen
   - atmospheric oxygen must reach a threshold after which UV shielding becomes effective
   - increase of atmospheric lifetime of oxygen (not broken down by UV radiation)
   - GOE marks switch between the low oxygen and higher oxygen steady states
5. Irreversible oxidation caused by loss of hydrogen
   - all original hydrogen and helium lost
   - all other hydrogen essentially comes from water as it is the most abundant molecule containing hydrogen
   - water broken up high in atmosphere, hydrogen gets lost in space, net increase in oxygen

## Mass (in-)dependent fractionation

Mass dependent fractionation occurs through biogeochemical processes that for example fractionate sulfur.

Mass independent fractionation may be caused through intense short wavelength UV radioation after reaction of volcanic gases.

## Faint Young Sun Paradox

Early sun had lower luminosity.

Why was it not frozen over? Probably because of Methane, a greenhouse gas.

## Snowball Earth hypothesis

Rise in oxygen would lower methane levels in the atmosphere which would cool the planet.

Near-global glaciations around the same time as the GOE.

Snowball events are cause by a feedback effect: ice increases albedo of planet (reflection), causing cooling and more ice.

How does it end? Accumulation of greenhouse gasses!

## Importance of rise of oxygen generally

Oxygen is highly reactive and can produce reactive oxygen species.

### Rise of multicellular life

Aerobic respiration: $C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \to 6CO_2 + 6H_2O$

10 times more efficient at generating ATP than anaerobic metabolisms... complex life!

Why is oxygen important?
- more gibbs free energy
- allows for aerobic respiration

More oxygen means more energy
- greater complexity
- greater biomass

### Rise of animals?

Shortly after the second rise in oxygen.
At the beginning of 542 Ma hard bodied remains burst into the fossil record.

- Ediacaran fauna disappears at this time
- Termed "The Cambrian Explosion"
- Ability to precipitate minerals for skeletons and hard shells, more easily preserved

# Mass extinctions

## What is an extinction?

Occur when the last individual of a species dies out.

A mass extinction is a rapid and catastrophic loss of species.

Funcitonal extinctions occur when individuals remain but the odds of sustainable reproduction are low.

## Causes

Environment changes faster than the species can adapt.

Can be local, widespread or global.

1. Plate tectonics and sea level changes
2. Volcanic activity
3. Climate change
4. Extraterrestrial
5. Biological
6. Multiple

## Trend of diversity

A lot of species are dying.

Half of bird an mammal species won't be alive in 200 to 300 years.

Today we may be losing up to 30k species a year.

Almost a quarter of the worlds mammals face extinction within the next 30 years. 


## Impact at the end of Cretaceous

Lines of evidence.

### Iridium spike

Very high Iridium concentration at the K-T boundary. Otherwise Iridium is very rare on Earth. 

Spike occurs globally, unrelated to location or conditions. 

Idea: Asteroid impact caused a cloud of debris which could then be spread around the planet.

### Shocked quartz

"Shock Metamorphism" - i.e. a shock wave from pressure caused by the impact altering the rocks - high temperature and pressure.

Has only been observed as meteorite impact sites and nuclear test sites.

Planet deformation features are found in quartz and suggest shock alteration of quartz caused by impact. 

### Tektites

Glass beads found in boundary sediments.

Due to melting of rock by energy of bolide (asteroid or comet) impact?

### Consequences

Impact winter
- debris injected into atmosphere
- gloabl wildfires
- blocking of sunlight
- death of plants
- destruction of ozone?

Blocks out sunlight, shuts down foodwebs.

Survival of the luckiest?

## End-Permian extinction

> The mother of all mass extinctions

Coincided with final assembly of Pangea and Eruption of Siberian Traps


## Avoid impact induced extinctions

One idea: becoming multiplanetary to provide redundancies.

# Habitability

## What is habitability?

A Habitat is an environment that can support the activity (maintenance, growth or reproduction) of at least one known organism.

In the short-term:
- CHNOPS
- Liquid (water)
- Energy
- Suitable physical and chemical conditions
- other nutrients

In the long-term:
- suitable temperature range
- geochemical turnover

## Is Mars habitable?

CHNOPS:
- C: $CO_2$, $CO$, carbonates
- H: Water, Methane??
- N: not known, possibly some fixed nitrogen
- O: sulfates, water, oxides
- P: apatite
- S: sulfates, sulfides

Other nutrients:
- Mg, Ca, Na, K, Fe, etc etc in rocks

Water:
- Brines?
- Polar ice transiently melted at high obliquity
- there used to be flowing water on Mars

Energy
- Anaerobic
- Anoxygenic Phtosynthesis: Not water!
- Iron and sulfate reduction: Electron donor? Hydrogen or organics?
- Iron oxidation: Electron acceptor?
- Fermentation: Where are the organics?
- VERY ENERGY LIMITED?

Physical conditions
- pH (neutral in some, acid in others)
- Radiation (very high on surface, lower below)
- Pressure (OK for growth and particularly underground)
- no known toxins that would prevent life
- temperature (higher than -25C)

Conclusion
- no major showstoppers for life (source of N unknown, though)
- best place to look: underground
- Mars probably has habitable environments

## The habitable zone

Inner region: 0.85 AU (greenhouse effect)
Outer region: 1.4 AU (clouds condense $CO_2$)

Inner region: 0.97 AU (less extreme greenhouse effect)
Outer region: 1.7 AU (too cold for greenhouse)

## Stellar type and its influence on habitablility

The radii of the habitable region varies depending on the stellar type.
$R_F > R_G > R_M$

## The galactic habitable zone

Variables: Time of formation, Galactocentric distance
Problems: Too Metal poor, Too many SNe, Too Metal Rich

## Habitable == Inhabited?

Two types of uninhabited habitats in the Universe

### Uninhabited habitats on an inhabited planet

Results from a transient habitat, lack of transfer mechanisms for life (i.e. lack of interconnectivity) into newly created or newly sterilized habitats, or lack of appropriately evolved biochemistries for a particular habitat.

### Uninhabited habitats on an uninhabited planet

Would result from the lack of an origin of life and a lack of transfer of life from another planet, but the presence of habitable conditions.

### Significance of uninhabited habitats

- Habitability decoupled from the presence of life
- potentially significant percentage of the Universe's habitable spaces
- would provide control environments to answer questions about role of life in Earth system processes
- environments to understand the origin of life
- Should we deliberately introduce life into uninhabited habitats?

# Life on exoplanets

## Biosignatures

1. produced by life
2. produced by negligible amounts by abiotic processes
3. clearly detectable signature

## Technosignature

e.g. $N_2O$, increased with technology.

## Oxygen

Abiotic production of oxygen by photolysis of water.

Only noticable in high concentrations, because of tendency to react with rocks. (smaller planets? lots of water?)

## Miss-judgements

- abiotic methane
- black plants 
- life below surface 

## TL;DR

- many gases have nothing to do with biology
- some gases can be used as biosignatures
- we have to be careful of 'false-positive' detection of biosignature gases
- biosignatures might be difficult to see in clouds
- Earths BS only for last 2.4 Ga
- technosignatures?
- only way to detect extraterrestrial life

# Mars

## History of water on Mars

- water decreased over time
- disappeared completely between 4 and 3.5 Ga
- watery -> sulferic -> dry

## Implicatons

Surface is probably not habitable anymore. It used to be like Earth.

Probably no life on Mars.

## Major facts that influence habitability

- UV and ionizing radiation (no magnetic field anymore)
- low surface pressure

## Geophysical and Atmospheric reasons why Mars lost surface liquid water

- Mars lost its atmosphere due to
  1. sputtering by the solar wind
  2. impact erosion 
    - asteroids slammed into mars
    - heated up atmosphere
    - lower escape velocity means loss of atmosphere
    - probably about 80% during late heavy bombardment
  3. hydrodynamic escape 
    - atoms like hydrogen were introduced by asteroids
    - lighter, faster atoms can move heavier atoms out of the atmosphere
- loss of atmosphere means decrease in pressure
- lower pressure lets liquid water evaporate

## Mars meteorites (What are they? How can we be sure?)

- gases in meteorites match with martian atmosphere

## Evidence for life in Martian meteorites

Microbic fossils.

Mineral grains of magnetite that some bacteria make. 

Organic compounds called PAHs.

ALL of those things are possible without biology, though. 
Therefore this is not good evidence.

## Mars analog environments

Example: Boulby
- salty environment
- dark

Exploring habitability.
Testing technology.

## Main concepts for the human exploration of Mars

- have control structures for experiments (e.g. heat up samples to kill off potential life)
- use solar power
- build launch pad
- fuel collection: Sabatier reaction (Methane/Hydrogen)

# Icy Moons

## Energy of Jovian Moons

Tidal heating because of eccentric orbit around Jupiter.

- Io: about 100m, significant heating
- Europa: about 50m, smaller but significant
- Ganymede and Callisto significantly less ($\frac{1}{R^4}$)

Tidal heating is due to eccentricity caused by resonance (4:2:1) with other moons.

## Habitability of Europa

- almost tidally locked
- 3.5 day period
- smaller and less dense than our moon
- regular delivery of organic materials through comets because of Jupiter

### Surface 

- very flat, like a billard ball
- few craters, suggest regular renewal
- icy surface is covered with bands
- 103K mean, min. 50K
- bands probably caused by newer ice rising from below
- flat region suggest local melting; local heating? thing layer?
- raft depth: 470-2200m; ice sheet probably MUCH thicker

### Subsurface Ocean

- generates induced magnetic field
- ice layer on top up to 100km thick
- liquid water below

### Other criteria

CHNOPS
- from comets, asteroids and the rocky core

Energy
- Radiation
- Organics
- Redox couples
- Sunlight

Nutrients
- from bombardment
- from the crust

## Interest in other Jovian moons

- human base on Callisto: staging, fuel depot, ...
- Ganymede and Callisto may have subsurface oceans
- Callisto most ancient surface; stable and low radiation -> good for humans
- Io is too active; might give valuable insight in the Solar System
