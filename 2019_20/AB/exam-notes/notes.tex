\section{Habitability}
\subsection{The environment}
\B{Keplers's Laws}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The orbit of each planet is an ellipse with the Sun (or another star) at one focus.
    \item The radius vector to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal time.
    \item The squares of the sidereal periods of the planets orbits are proportional to the cubes of the semimajor axes of their orbits. ($T^2=ka^3$)
\end{enumerate}
\B{Newton's Laws}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An object moves at a constant velocity if there is no net force acting upon it.
    \item $\vec F = m \vec a$
    \item For every force, there is an equal but opposite reaction force.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Low mass stars}
General information:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $M < 2M_{Sun}$
    \item lifetime of around 10 billion years
    \item hydrogen burning around the core
    \item helium burning when $T > 100 \times 10^6$
    \item helium flash: core initially supported by electron degeneracy pressure so $T$ increases rapidly
    \item double shell burning around carbon core
    \item outer layers ejected into space
    \item planetary nebula and white dwarf
\end{itemize}
\subsection{High mass stars}

    \item reach the main-sequence in less than 150000 years
    \item lifetime of around 10 million years
    \item $L\approx M^4$ ($\Rightarrow$ much brighter)
    \item higher temperatures $\Rightarrow$ CNO cycle
\end{itemize}
Becoming a super giant:
\begin{itemize}
    \item hydrogen burning in shell around helium core
    \item no helium flash, thermal pressure still high
    \item helium burning for few hundred thousand years
    \item at $600 \times 10^6K$ carbon fusion starts
\end{itemize}

    \item burning starts again
    \item H, He, C, O, Ne, Mg, Si, Fe
\end{itemize}
Death of a high mass star:

    \item starts collapsing
    \item electron degeneracy pressure is overcome by gravity
    \item protons and electrons combine to neutrons
    \item iron core collapses into ball of neutrons
