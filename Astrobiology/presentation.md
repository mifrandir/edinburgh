### The founding of SpaceX

- in 2002
- publicity stunt
- goal: 
    - increase interest in space exploration
    - increase NASA budget
- failure of buying affordable rockets
    - plan was to look in russia
    - wanted to land greenhouse and grow plants on mars
    - "This would be the furthest that life has ever traveled."
- material cost of rockets were only 3% of price
- idea of building rockets by making 85% of parts to limit price
- reusability is another factor
